# fun-with-bazsh

dump of dummy bash/zsh scripts

## pa-translator.sh

Takes an airplane registration number and prints all the code words.
For example, input TI-BAZ would outpu Tango - India - Bravo - Alpha - Zulu

## cd-wrapper.sh

wraps the unix cd (change directory) tool and aliases it to a function
that instead of only cd'ing, checks if the directory exists, if it
doesn't, then creates it to finally invoke original cd

# search-alias.sh

It shows all the aliases defined that contains the provided 
keyword(s).
Useful when you use oh-my-zsh plugins that define a bunch of new aliases
(git-extras for example) and you don't know all of them but, deep inside you,
want to learn them.
